In this project, I will explore what it really means to use the random function. To my knowledge, it is extremely difficult or even impossible to simulate true randomness with a computer. I will be exploring how computers pick random numbers by simulating a draw of a poker hand.

The higher numbers and suits of the cards are represented as integers. Smaller the integer, the higher the card is in the deck. 

I will be using random.shuffle and will be picking five cards to see if there are any poker combination. 

"from operator import \*" is for countOf method used in Deal function

Finished writing the deal function. Need to write a test function to ensure it works properly
##
finished writing trial function to calcualte the total percentage of hands from specified number of draws
Need to run multiple trials to get the average
